# ü§ñ AI Chatbot using Transformer Models (BERT/GPT)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Status:** This project is in its **initial phase**.  
> üìå The plan is **tentative** and may change as the project evolves.

## üìå Project Overview
This project aims to develop an **AI-powered chatbot** leveraging **Transformer-based models** such as **BERT** and **GPT**. The chatbot will be capable of understanding natural language queries, generating contextual responses, and adapting to domain-specific knowledge.  

The long-term goal is to build a system that is not only **conversationally intelligent** but also **scalable** for various applications such as **customer support, education, and research assistance**.

## üöÄ High-Level Project Plan (Tentative)
### **Phase 1 ‚Äì Research & Setup**
- Review state-of-the-art transformer architectures (BERT, GPT-2, GPT-3).
- Explore pre-trained models and fine-tuning techniques.
- Set up initial environment (PyTorch/TensorFlow, Hugging Face Transformers).

### **Phase 2 ‚Äì Prototype Development**
- Implement a **basic chatbot pipeline**:
  - Preprocessing of input queries.
  - Model inference using pre-trained BERT/GPT.
  - Simple response generation.
- Deploy a minimal Flask/Streamlit interface.

### **Phase 3 ‚Äì Advanced Features**
- Add **context retention** (multi-turn conversations).
- Integrate **knowledge grounding** from domain-specific datasets.
- Explore **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** for factual responses.

### **Phase 4 ‚Äì Evaluation & Optimization**
- Benchmark chatbot performance using:
  - **BLEU, ROUGE, and perplexity** scores.
  - **Human evaluation** for conversational quality.
- Optimize model response time and memory usage.

### **Phase 5 ‚Äì Deployment**
- Containerize with **Docker**.
- Deploy to **cloud platforms (AWS/GCP/Azure/Render)**.
- Provide REST API for integration with other applications.
